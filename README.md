# COVID-19 analysis
 Analyzing and visualizing data from Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data source

This repo uses jupyter notebooks to import raw .csv files from the JHU COVID-19 GitHub page, assemble into a single file, and perform interactive data visualizations.

Feel free to make your own forks. I am using this as a learning tool to manage data files and visualizations.
